Tasks:
  - Write tests
      - clCreateContextFromType
      - clCreateProgramWithBinary
      - clUnloadCompiler
      - Synchronization primitives
      - callback functions and clSetUserEventStatus
  - Code coverage of tests
  - Write larger example program (for instance, port an example
    program from AMD or NVIDIA OpenCL distribution)
  - Write documentation and verify that the haddock output looks nice
  - Implement the missing functionality (see below).

Use clCreateProgramWithBinary and programBinaries to implement a
 file based storage of compiled kernels
