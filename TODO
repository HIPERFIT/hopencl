Tasks:
  - Write tests
      - clCreateContextFromType
      - clCreateProgramWithBinary
      - clUnloadCompiler
      - Synchronization primitives
      - callback functions and clSetUserEventStatus
  - Code coverage of tests
  - Write larger example program (for instance, port an example
    program from AMD or NVIDIA OpenCL distribution)
  - Write documentation and verify that the haddock output looks nice
  - Implement the missing functionality (see below).

Use clCreateProgramWithBinary and programBinaries to implement a
 file based storage of compiled kernels

  clCreateContextFromType: 
    Support adding callback error function

Define new callback datatype (like Maybe) and combine createContext
   and createContextWithCallback

Extend CommandExecStatus to include negativ error values (see
   setEventCallback and page 145 in the opencl spec v1.1)

The following operations are currently not supported by HOpenCL:
----------------------------------------------------------------
  clCreateSubBuffer
  clEnqueueReadBufferRect
  clEnqueueWriteBufferRect
  clEnqueueCopyBufferRect
  clEnqueueMapBuffer
  clEnqueueUnmapMemObject
  clEnqueueNativeKernel

The following full sections of the OpenCL standard is not supported:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Image Objects (section 5.3)
 * Sampler Objects (section 5.5)
 * Profiling of memory objects and kernels (section 5.12)
 * Extensions of the OpenCL standard involving the API
 * OpenGL and D3D related functions
